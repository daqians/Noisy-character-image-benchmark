# Noisy-character-image-benchmark


We build a real-world degraded character image dataset by selecting from the historical Chinese character and oracle document datasets. The reason for selecting such images is that most of them contain complex real-world degradation. The dataset includes training and testing sets consisting of noisy-clean character image pairs.

Where:
- denoise: The benchmark for charater image denoising, where includes real-world noise. We produce these images by removing noise from the original character images.
- repair: The benchmark for charater image restoration, where includes real-world noise. We produce these images by removing noise from the original character images, and also repair the broken charatcers. 
- test: data for testing purpose.
