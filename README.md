# Noisy-character-image-benchmark


We build a real-world degraded character image dataset by selecting from the historical Chinese character and oracle document datasets. The reason for selecting such images is that most of them contain complex real-world degradation. The dataset includes training and testing sets consisting of noisy-clean character image pairs.

Where:
- denoise: The benchmark for character image denoising, which includes real-world noise. We produce these images by removing noise from the original character images.
- restore: The benchmark for character image restoration, which includes real-world noise. We produce these images by removing noise from the original character images and also repairing the broken characters.
- gray: The benchmark for character image denoising, which includes real-world noise with a gray background. We produce these images by removing noise from the original character images. 
- test: data for testing purposes.
